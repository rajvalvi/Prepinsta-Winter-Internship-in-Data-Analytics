# PrepInsta Winter Internship - Week 4
## Overview
Week 4 of the PrepInsta Winter Internship primarily focused on data visualization using Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib). The objective was to recreate a visualization akin to Hans Rosling's motion graph, delving into global health indicators, life expectancy, fertility rates, and population trends from 1960 to 2016.

## Project Highlights
- Data Collection & Preprocessing:
  - Gathered and consolidated datasets comprising life expectancy, fertility rates, and country population from 1960 to 2016.
  - Conducted data cleaning, handled missing values, and ensured data consistency.

- Visualization Tasks:
  - Reproduced Rosling's animation to showcase life expectancy, fertility rates, and population trends across countries and regions.
  - Employed scatter plots, line charts, and distribution graphs to explore various data facets.
  - Conducted correlation analysis to unveil relationships between health indicators.

## Challenges & Recommendations
- Challenges Faced:

  - Managing large datasets spanning 1960-2016 required efficient handling and processing.
  - Ensuring accurate alignment and merging of datasets presented initial complexities.
- Recommendations:

  - Encouragement to actively engage in peer feedback and leverage community support for problem-solving.
  - Encouragement to explore additional visualization techniques for deeper analysis.

# Conclusion
Week 4 was an immersive journey into data visualization techniques, leveraging Python libraries to recreate compelling visualizations similar
to Hans Rosling's motion graph. The gained insights provided a profound understanding of global health indicators, population trends, and correlations, 
fostering a deeper appreciation of data-driven insights.
