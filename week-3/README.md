🚀 Delving deep into data cleaning and analysis in Week 3! 💡
During my internship data analytics , this week I tackled real-world datasets,
developing my skills with hands-on assignments. From cleaning messy data to looking after hidden insights, the experience was both challenging and rewarding. 💻💡

Thanks Rushikesh Konapure for this data set. Also big thanks to PrepInsta and Atulya Kaushik for hosting this Winter Internship.
🔍 In one assignment, I cleaned a dataset, handling missing values, and standardizing columns for a seamless analysis process. 🧹✨ Another task involved diving into a really messed up dataset, exploring, quantitites, items and prices relationships, ensuring data integrity, and transforming categorical data for clearer insights. 🌮📊

🧩 Each step of the way presented unique puzzles to solve, from managing special characters to cross-validating values for integrity checks. The journey through these assignments was a masterclass in Pandas and data wrangling techniques. 📈✅
🔑 Week 3 has been an enlightening chapter, solidifying my foundation in data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

Looking ahead for what lies ahead in this thrilling data-driven adventure! 🌟🔍
